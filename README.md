# BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF APP #
## Describe: pigLatin is a web app that rearranges the user input in a manner designed by the developer. 
### Test: "It will add 'acedu' to the end of words that begin with a vowel."
### It will take the first alphabeth of any word that starts with a consonant and swith it to the end of the word and concat(add) the result with the string "ayac"
### Third rule, the app takes the user word and takes the first two letter if the word has the alphabeth "qu" starting the word and concat (add) the result with "ayac" and displays the result.

### Example: if user types away the app would siple add acedu to the userword;
### Expected Output: "awayacedu"

### Example 2: if the user types "typical" the app would take the first alphabeth as its a consonant and move it to the end of the word and add "ayac" to the result.
### Expected Output: "ypicaltayac"

### Example 3: user types a word like quack, app takes the first two alphabeth as it contains "q" and "u" as the first two alphabeths and move them to the end of the word and add ayac to the result.
